# EncFileManager - Phase 1 (Project Skeleton)

## Course
**OOP - Object-Oriented Programming**  
Instructor: [Alaa Khalaf]

## Project Stage
**This is Phase 1 of the project** – only the basic project skeleton and file handling classes have been implemented.  
Future phases will include encryption, advanced features, and contributions from the team.

## Team

- Learn file handling (read, write, delete, rename)
- Practice OOP basics (classes, methods, properties)
- Prepare the project for future encryption features
